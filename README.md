# Heritage-Treasures
This project, “Heritage Treasures: An In-Depth Analysis of UNESCO World Heritage Sites”, was completed as part of a team submission. However, we would like to clarify that only Harsha Priya (Team Lead) and Sarvisetty Hemeswara Kumar actively contributed to the planning, development, data visualization, documentation, and final delivery of this project.

Unfortunately, our other assigned teammates — Bowjanku Jasmin and Omkareswar Komma — did not participate in any phase of the project.

We are documenting this for transparency and credit accuracy.
